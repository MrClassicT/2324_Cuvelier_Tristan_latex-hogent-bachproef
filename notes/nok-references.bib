Now that you're in college, you're going to need to upgrade some of those items you're taking with you if you want to succeed. This is a whole new adventure, my dude.

One of the tools you have at your disposal is your notes. Maybe in high school you were pretty good at taking notes, and now you just need to upgrade them a little bit. Maybe you're feeling like I did in college, and you've realized you've never properly learned how to take notes.

Never fear! Your guide to taking awesome, effective notes is finally here. Your days of looking back at what you scribbled down in class and trying to decipher useful information from them before a test are over.

In this guide, we'll talk about how to prepare yourself to take good notes in class, introduce some popular techniques for taking notes, and cover the best ways to get the most out of your notes after class.},

An Agile release may consist of multiple program increments (PIs). Being able to fully test new features and ensure there is no regression in existing ones is always challenging. A clear test strategy should be an integral part of every new feature. Ensuring a quality architect (or a very senior quality-passionate technical individual) is included in conversations when a new feature is discussed will be necessary to get the proper level of attention on this very important topic.},
